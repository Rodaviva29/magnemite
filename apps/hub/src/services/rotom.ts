/**
 * RotomNG integration.
 *
 * Rotom is the thing that actually knows whether a box is scanning, which
 * makes it a health signal Magnemite cannot produce on its own — a box can be
 * online, heartbeating, and handing Rotom nothing.
 *
 * That is now the whole of it. Rotom used to be wired into installs as well:
 * the box was disabled before one and re-enabled after, and "did the update
 * work" was answered by it reappearing with live workers. That coupling is
 * gone. It made every rollout depend on a second service being reachable and
 * agreeing, and the install pipeline has its own verification. What is left is
 * three things, all read-only or operator-driven:
 *
 *  - `syncDevices` keeps each box's scanning state current, on the interval
 *    set in Settings → Tuning;
 *  - monitoring reads that state as the `ROTOM_DISCONNECTED`,
 *    `ROTOM_NOT_SCANNING` and `ROTOM_IDLE` signals, and can restart, drop or
 *    reboot a box through Rotom as a remediation;
 *  - the device page offers the same actions by hand.
 *
 * API reference: https://github.com/UnownHash/RotomNG/blob/main/docs/RotomNG-API.md

/**
 * Parsed rather than cast.
 *
 * The whole fleet's scanning state comes out of this one response, and the

 * it. Read with a cast, a renamed field turns into `Boolean(undefined)` — a
 * confident *false* — and the fleet is declared disconnected in one pass. Every
 * field below is therefore optional and a device that does not parse is
 * skipped, so the failure mode of a Rotom that changed shape is silence rather

 * early, and each rejection pushes the sync a whole tick later. Costing a

 * the five the form floors it at; the wake-up itself reads a cached object and
