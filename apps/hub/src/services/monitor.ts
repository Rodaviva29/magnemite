 * the evidence is a window of the scanner's own log and shipping that every
 * twenty seconds would cost more than the heartbeat. The hub keeps the
 * counters and decides, because escalation is a fleet-wide policy and because
 * a box that has locked up is in no position to decide to reboot itself.
 *
 * What this file is mostly made of is refusals. A watchdog that acts whenever
 * it is unsure is worse than none: the failure mode is a fleet that reboots
