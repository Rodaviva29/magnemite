 * directory, which is the volume the edge already serves `/files/*` from behind
 * the device token — so a box downloads its new binary exactly the way it
 * downloads an .apkm, and Node stays out of the data path.
 *
 * A box that reconnects on an older version is then told to update itself.
 * Deploying the hub is the whole release: nothing is uploaded by hand, no
 * checksum is copied around, and a box that was powered off for a month
 * catches up the moment it dials in.
