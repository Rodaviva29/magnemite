 * - A known placeholder with no value would be substituted with an empty

 *   this fires often on a fresh fleet — saying which box and which field is
 *   what keeps that from reading as broken.
 *
 * The value is JSON-escaped on the way in. A config is JSON — the dashboard
 * refuses to save a template that is not — and every placeholder it can save
 * therefore sits inside a string literal, while the values are free-form
 * operator text: a box renamed `Kitchen "spare"` would otherwise render a file
 * that does not parse, and one named `x", "rotomUrl": "http://elsewhere` would
