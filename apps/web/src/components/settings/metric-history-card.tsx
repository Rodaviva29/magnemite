 * How much history to keep, in two pairs.

 * One card because both answer the same two questions — how often to keep one,
 * and how long it lives — and two groups because the answers are independent.
 * They were one pair once, shared, and that made the scanner history inherit a
 * rule about heartbeats: it could never be finer than a beat, though Rotom is
 * asked more than twice as often as one.
 *
 * Each group names the number it is floored by rather than restating it as a
 * rule, because that number lives on a different card and "60s, the heartbeat"
 * is the whole explanation.
