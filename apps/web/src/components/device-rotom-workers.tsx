/**
 * The workers behind a box's numbers.
 *
 * Rendered from what the page already loaded, with no fetching of its own. The
 * hub keeps the last fleet sync's worker rows in memory and hands them over;
 * the sync had them anyway, since it asks for `include_workers=true` to compute
 * the request rate on the card beside this.
 *
 * It used to read them live, one box at a time, whenever the page re-rendered.
 * That was a call to Rotom driven by a page being open — and this page
 * re-renders on the fleet's own event feed, so during a rollout it was up to
 * one call a second over events about other boxes entirely. Rotom's own
 * dashboard never had that problem because it never had the second read: it
 * polls once and every view selects out of the same response.
 *
 * The cost is that the table is as of the last sync rather than as of now,
 * which the header says out loud instead of claiming to be live.
 *
 * Sorted and paged like the fleet and version tables, and for the reason those
 * are: a box with eight workers is a list, a box with fifty is a table, and the
 * second one is unreadable without a way to order it and a floor under how much
 * of it lands on screen at once.
