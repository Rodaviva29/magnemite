 * The "are you sure" for something destructive.
 *
 * `confirm()` was doing this job, and it is the wrong tool twice over: it
 * looks like the browser rather than the app, and it can only ask — it cannot
 * report that the answer was no. Deleting through a server action can fail for
 * a reason the person needs to read (a target still pinned by a rollout), so
 * this stays open and shows it rather than closing on a failure it never
 * mentioned.
 *
 * Deliberately dumb: the caller owns the transition and the error, because it
 * is the caller that knows what the action returned.
