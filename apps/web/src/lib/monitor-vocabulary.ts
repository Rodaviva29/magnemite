/**
 * The words the monitoring UI uses, in one place.
 *
 * Both screens name the same seven signals and nine actions — the rules editor
 * in the present tense ("Restart the app") and the activity feed in the past
 * ("Restarted the app") — and they had drifted into two hand-kept lists. A
 * signal added to one and forgotten in the other shows up as a raw enum in
 * front of somebody trying to read an incident, so they live here together.
 *
 * The metadata beside each label is what lets the form ask for only what a
 * signal actually needs: a probe is the whole rule for a log check and is never
 * read for an unreachable box, and a form that offers both equally is a form
 * that has to be learned rather than read.
